This project is organized as follows:
Table of Contents

Load in the data. 
1.  The target column should be considered as whether a patient will develop
heart disease or not
.
2. Explore the data. Notice all columns are numerical. Therefore separate the continuous from
the discrete features.

3. Identify any presence of outliers in the continuous features and resolve them using the IQR
method.

4. Binned the continuous column values apart from the column ‘oldpeak’.

6. Separate the features from the labels and use the most appropriate feature selection
technique(s).

6. Slice the data and scale the features.
 
7. Identify the data if the data is balanced. If not, sample the data using the most appropriate
method keeping the size of the data in mind.


8. Using at least 4 classification methods, identify the best machine learning model using their
training and testing accuracy scores.

9. Hyper parameter tune the best model using grid search to identify the best performing
model.

10. Redefine the model instance based on the grid search results, train it and evaluate it using:

a. A classification report.

b. A visual representation and well labelled confusion matrix.

c. AUC score. (Explain the score in a markdown cell.)

d. ROC curve.

11. Based on the results on the ROC curve, which threshold would be ideal given the nature of
the data? (Explain in a markdown cell.)

12. Save the model as ‘classification_mode

Goal: Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome. Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy. Examine trends & correlations within our data Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis
